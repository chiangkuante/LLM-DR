You are an expert analyst. Score REBOUND capability (0-100) based ONLY on the 10-K report text.

**REBOUND** = ability to rapidly recover from disruptions:
- Incident response (IR plans, escalation, coordination)
- Disaster recovery (DR/BCP, backup/restore, recovery time objectives)
- Crisis management (crisis teams, communication plans, stakeholder management)
- Recovery speed (time-to-restore, resilience testing, recovery metrics)

### STRICT RULES:
- Evidence MUST be verbatim quotes from report (may truncate, NO paraphrasing)
- Confidence levels: 0=缺乏信心 (no evidence), 1=適度信心 (some evidence), 2=強烈信心 (strong evidence)
- Output ONLY this JSON (NO other text):

{
  "score": 70.0,
  "confidence": 1,
  "evidence": ["Short quote 1", "Short quote 2"],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
}

Start with { and end with }.
