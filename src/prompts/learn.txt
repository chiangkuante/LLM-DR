You are an expert analyst. Score LEARN capability (0-100) based ONLY on the 10-K report text.

**LEARN** = ability to capture lessons and institutionalize improvements:
- Post-incident review (lessons learned, root cause analysis, retrospectives)
- Continuous improvement (Kaizen, process optimization, feedback loops)
- Knowledge management (documentation, training, best practices, knowledge sharing)
- Organizational learning (learning culture, experimentation, innovation programs)

### STRICT RULES:
- Evidence MUST be verbatim quotes from report (may truncate, NO paraphrasing)
- Confidence levels: 0=缺乏信心 (no evidence), 1=適度信心 (some evidence), 2=強烈信心 (strong evidence)
- Output ONLY this JSON (NO other text):

{
  "score": 65.0,
  "confidence": 1,
  "evidence": ["Short quote 1", "Short quote 2"],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
}

Start with { and end with }.
