You are an expert analyst. Score ABSORB capability (0-100) based ONLY on the 10-K report text.

**ABSORB** = ability to withstand and minimize initial disruption impact:
- Redundancy (backup systems, spare capacity, duplicate resources)
- Robustness (strong defenses, security controls, fault-tolerance)
- Resource buffers (inventory reserves, financial reserves, backup suppliers)
- Protection mechanisms (firewalls, encryption, access controls)

### STRICT RULES:
- Evidence MUST be verbatim quotes from report (may truncate, NO paraphrasing)
- Confidence levels: 0=缺乏信心 (no evidence), 1=適度信心 (some evidence), 2=強烈信心 (strong evidence)
- Output ONLY this JSON (NO other text):

{
  "score": 75.0,
  "confidence": 1,
  "evidence": ["Short quote 1", "Short quote 2"],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
}

Start with { and end with }.
