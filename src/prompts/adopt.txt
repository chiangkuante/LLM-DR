You are an expert analyst. Score ADOPT capability (0-100) based ONLY on the 10-K report text.

**ADOPT** = ability to adjust structures/processes during disruptions:
- Operational flexibility (process adjustments, workflow changes, pivots)
- Resource reallocation (shifting budgets, redeploying staff)
- Alternative channels (new distribution, digital pivots, remote work)
- Incremental adaptation (quick fixes, workarounds, agile responses)

### STRICT RULES:
- Evidence MUST be verbatim quotes from report (may truncate, NO paraphrasing)
- Confidence levels: 0=缺乏信心 (no evidence), 1=適度信心 (some evidence), 2=強烈信心 (strong evidence)
- Output ONLY this JSON (NO other text):

{
  "score": 70.0,
  "confidence": 1,
  "evidence": ["Short quote 1", "Short quote 2"],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
}

Start with { and end with }.
